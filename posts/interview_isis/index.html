<p><strong>Kévin Monfermé, better known on Root-Me under the nickname of Isis, started his reorientation a year and a half ago in cybersecurity. He met people who are passionate about this field and that&rsquo;s what motivated him to experiment on Root-Me. He confirmed his choice by creating a podcast on Discord to exchange live with experts in the field. Isis talks with generosity and passion about his new job and shares valuable advice and resources for those who, like him, are considering a career change or are starting out in cybersecurity.</strong></p>
<h1 id="introduction--presentation">Introduction / Presentation</h1>
<h2 id="who-are-you-and-what-are-you-currently-doing-">Who are you and what are you currently doing ?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m Kévin Monfermé <a href="https://twitter.com/0x1sis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">@Isis</a>, currently a student at ESNA in Rennes in the 1st year of the BTS SIO (Computer Services for Organizations) and in a work-study program at ALTEN.</p>
<h2 id="what-got-you-into-cybersecurity-">What got you into cybersecurity ?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting from a long way because I&rsquo;m coming from a Bac PRO Commerce at the beginning. Since a long time I love to touch the source code of games and I wanted to learn about the subject. My meeting with <a href="https://twitter.com/podalirius_" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Podalirius</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/TheLaluka" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Laluka</a> put me on the path of Root-Me and cybersecurity. I wanted to do something for a community that wants to learn what the job really is, people like me actually! So I started a podcast on Discord. It was in October 2022 during the cybersecurity month.</p>
<p>The idea was to invite 2 people per month who explain their job, their background, share tips for those interested in the field. We shared in a live and relaxed mode. I had the chance to interview <a href="https://twitter.com/voydstack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Voydstack</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Ruulian_" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Ruulian</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/kevin_mizu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Mizu</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/podalirius_" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Podalirius</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/TheLaluka" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Laluka</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/0xSoEasY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">SoEasy</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/_Worty" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Worty</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/xanhacks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Xanhacks</a>, but also freelance devs. About 50 students were following in real time and asking questions, which also helped them in their journey. I enjoyed doing this podcast to help people find their way, some of them also went on to reorient themselves. I didn&rsquo;t know the technical stuff, but I&rsquo;m relatively comfortable with relationships, probably because of my early career in sales. I think that it is the fact of linking the two aspects: the human and the technical that made people adhere to the project.</p>
<p>The people I met at that time are still friends now. The people I interviewed gave me precious advice on how to learn, where to go to look for information, and reinforced my project of reorientation.</p>
<h2 id="how-did-you-experience-your-career-change-">How did you experience your career change ?</h2>
<p>The beginning was complicated because I stopped my studies after my Bac and went to work. It&rsquo;s true that going back to school after having experienced the working world is quite complicated. But if you are passionate about what you are doing, whether you are on a work-study program or going back to school remotely (I know that OpenClassroom offers this type of format), it is passion that drives you. I&rsquo;ve had more fun in the last 6 months with my work-study program than I had in a year of work the year before. Having a job only as a living, even if it can be satisfying for some aspects, it is not enough. You need passion.</p>
<h2 id="what-domains-are-you-particularly-interested-in-">What domains are you particularly interested in ?</h2>
<p>It all depends on what I want to do at the moment. At a certain point I was really into the web, a field in which I learned a lot. I remember that Mizu had made a presentation on a vulnerability, which fascinated me. I spent 2 weeks trying to understand how it worked. I got interested in malware development, with an ethical intent of course. The idea is to understand the technique behind it, how Windows really works, &hellip; The dev aspect fascinates me in general.</p>
<h1 id="cyber-experience">Cyber Experience</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-a-typical-day-like-a-typical-week-for-you-">What is a typical day like? A typical week for you ?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently working as a security developer in a two-week work-study program at school and two weeks at the company.  To take the example of my daily work, depending on the project I have big documentation phases: I do research to understand what has already been done on the subject, what I can already correct before <em>&ldquo;getting my hands dirty&rdquo;</em>. This phase is often longer than the development part, <strong>I would say that the documentation part represents 70% of the work</strong>. To sum up, in a day, I spend my morning documenting, in the afternoon I go and do a test that often doesn&rsquo;t work, so I debug and do another test, and so on.</p>
<h2 id="what-mistakes-were-you-making-when-you-first-started-in-this-industry-">What mistakes were you making when you first started in this industry ?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that I have enough background. Is a year and a half a real career? Generally speaking, what gave me the most trouble at the beginning was my impatience, I wanted to understand as many things as possible quickly. I realized that it was much more relevant to dig into one subject after another. Even if there is a way to dig deeper and deeper afterward. You should not hesitate to take breaks as well, rather than getting stuck on a subject for a long time and getting discouraged. Sometimes I found some solutions or ideas at times when I was away to do something else.</p>
<h2 id="do-you-have-an-interesting-story-to-share-with-us-about-your-cyber-career-">Do you have an interesting story to share with us about your cyber career ?</h2>
<p>When I started on Root-Me I was working from 8:30am to 4:30pm in an elementary school. I had set myself the challenge of completing the Steganography category. I would bring my PC to work and the kids would be intrigued by the images they saw on my screen. Explaining steganography to a 6 year old is complicated! I still managed to get through the category in just one month.</p>
<h2 id="what-were-your-main-challenges-in-learning-this-job-">What were your main challenges in learning this job ?</h2>
<p>Apart from what I mentioned being patient, <strong>I would say that the main challenge is to stay informed all the time</strong>, to keep a good watch so that you don&rsquo;t miss an important vulnerability or such and such an article that could help you integrate the right information for your future missions for example. Right now for example there is a news about ransomware targeting VMWare ESXi servers. This vulnerability has been around for 2 years but nobody has seen it. It&rsquo;s a challenge for everyone to stay as informed as possible, also to make your team aware when some people don&rsquo;t want to be interested in security. It&rsquo;s important to be up to date on vulnerability to anticipate, for example by doing Red team, pentest on other platforms. For the developer part of malware and tooling it&rsquo;s the same: if you know that there is a 0Day that has been released and that it becomes a OneDay, you look at how it was done, you get inspired and you can manage to find a variant somewhere. To summarize, the biggest challenge in cybersecurity is to get information.</p>
<p><strong>The difficulty is to find the right sources because there is a lot of information out there</strong>. There are people who claim to be cybersecurity influencers and communicate on Twitter, LinkedIn or other networks, but you realize quite quickly that the information shared is not technical. It&rsquo;s just compiled information that you can find anywhere else&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="what-good-sources-could-you-share-with-us-">What good sources could you share with us ?</h2>
<p>The most interesting is probably the articles of personal blogs and there it is also a matter of taste, we can appreciate or not the way the person has to explain things.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I follow <a href="https://thehackernews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">The HackerNews</a> which is a very famous media. I also follow the <a href="https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">CERT-FR</a> alerts and information that come out regularly, the reports published by the ANSSI.</p>
<p>Twitter can be a good network to identify people who can be good sources. For France for example I would say that <a href="https://twitter.com/NoobosaurusR3x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Noobosaurus R3x</a> is reliable, it verifies the information and does not publish anything. I also like his videos on Youtube, sometimes he approaches technical subjects and makes concrete demonstrations.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/podalirius_" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Podalirius</a> is also an interesting source to follow because he offers a good watch around Microsoft and offensive topics. I will also mention <a href="https://twitter.com/_nwodtuhs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Shutdown</a> to follow the release of new important tools.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-you-feel-you-do-better-with-experience-">What do you feel you do better with experience ?</h2>
<p>I understood the importance of monitoring but also the importance of putting techniques into practice. As long as you haven&rsquo;t experimented, it&rsquo;s hard to make sense of things. I don&rsquo;t hesitate now to get into practice as often as possible by also doing effective research to move forward. <strong>I consider things now more in steps, there are technical levels to pass before being able to advance</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="your-relation-with-root-me">Your relation with Root-Me</h1>
<h2 id="how-did-root-me-help-you-on-your-career-path-">How did Root-Me help you on your career path ?</h2>
<p><strong>Root-Me helped me a lot because I found my job, my training and the company that hired me on a work-study program thanks to the platform and its community!</strong> My boss was on Root-Me, he was part of the staff team. It&rsquo;s always easier when you show your CV and your Nickname and the person who is considering hiring you knows you from your activities on Root-Me! The director of my school accepted my application partly because of my Root-Me profile which had 3000 points at the time.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-your-favorite-type-of-challenge-and-why-">What is your favorite type of challenge and why ?</h2>
<p>Steganography of course remains my favorite category. I also like reverse challenges, even if I&rsquo;m training a lot on this subject by myself. The idea is to understand how a software works and to hijack it by finding a vulnerability in the code.
To train myself at this level I use <a href="https://www.vx-underground.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">VX Underground</a> which offers a whole directory of samples and malwares. I have a VM which is completely dedicated to this and on which I do malware reverse directly.</p>
<h2 id="what-aspects-of-root-me-do-you-appreciate-in-particular-">What aspects of Root-Me do you appreciate in particular ?</h2>
<p>I really appreciate the <a href="https://discord.gg/rootme" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Root-Me Discord</a> which is the place where you really connect with the community, you can exchange on any topic and find help from enthusiasts too.</p>
<h2 id="what-motivates-you-to-create-challenges-whats-the-benefit-for-you-">What motivates you to create challenges? What&rsquo;s the benefit for you ?</h2>
<p>I created <a href="https://www.root-me.org/en/Challenges/Steganography/EXIF-Metadata" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">one</a>, in steganography of course! We modified it recently. I&rsquo;d like to create others later if I have the time because I like to make people discover certain notions by this way. It goes in the direction of sharing too. And we also learn by creating challenges because designing them requires a lot of work in detail, understanding and debugging.</p>
<h2 id="until-today-what-are-your-best-achievements-on-root-me-">Until today, what are your best achievements on Root-Me ?</h2>
<p>Being part of a caring community and feeling respected.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-the-root-me-community-bring-to-you-that-you-cantdont-think-you-can-find-elsewhere-">What does the Root-Me community bring to you that you can&rsquo;t/don&rsquo;t think you can find elsewhere ?</h2>
<p>Personal and professional support as well because I know that if one day I need to find a job, I send an ad on the platform to say what I am looking for and ask if people have information and people will try to help me a little. This is not the case in all the networks.</p>
<h1 id="tips">Tips</h1>
<h2 id="in-your-opinion-what-are-the-main-qualities-needed-to-do-this-job-">In your opinion, what are the main qualities needed to do this job ?</h2>
<p>Curiosity and passion are imperative because they are the condition to push subjects.</p>
<h2 id="what-advice-would-you-give-to-someone-considering-a-career-change-in-this-domain-">What advice would you give to someone considering a career change in this domain ?</h2>
<p>The advice I would give to someone who is just starting out is not to panic because some people are better than him, often it&rsquo;s scary at the beginning when you&rsquo;re not able to follow some people who are much better than you.  I would also advise not to hesitate to ask questions, but to make sure you ask the right questions. I know that HacktBack has published a video on this topic: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD-y_-5xo_0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">&ldquo;How to have all your questions answered&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>It explains how to properly ask a technical question to make it easier for the people you&rsquo;re asking to answer. This video is super interesting.</p>
<p>I would also advise you to take your time to learn things, you don&rsquo;t necessarily move at the same speed as others, but there&rsquo;s no need to stress about it as long as you love what you do.</p>
<h2 id="which-person-particularly-inspires-you-and-why-">Which person particularly inspires you and why ?</h2>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/TheLaluka" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Laluka</a> because he is a person who is humanly incredible and has always helped people without asking for anything in return. In addition to these qualities, he is a technical monster.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-your-ambitions-for-the-future-">What are your ambitions for the future ?</h2>
<p>Continue to enjoy what I do every day, no matter what the job is, but keep this flame.</p>
