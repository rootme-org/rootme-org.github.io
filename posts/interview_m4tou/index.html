<p><strong>Specialist in maritime navigation, M4tou started a reorientation in 2017 in order to work in computer security. It was during his training in computer architecture design, cyber path, that he discovered Root-Me. In 2022, thanks to his engagement in the association, he joined the QA team which keeps the platform and the Root-Me challenges operational. Today, he is a Lead QA and is nearing the end of his training. He should soon be able to start a new professional adventure!</strong></p>
<h1 id="introduction--presentation">Introduction / Presentation</h1>
<h2 id="who-are-you-and-what-are-you-currently-doing">Who are you and what are you currently doing?</h2>
<p>I have just obtained my degree of computer architecture designer and I am preparing a last year of training to obtain the title of engineer. In parallel I try to get a first job in the field thanks to my diploma, while continuing my training on Root-Me.</p>
<h2 id="what-got-you-into-cybersecurity">What got you into cybersecurity?</h2>
<p>As a specialist in electronic maritime navigation, I have understood for several years that computer threats were going to impact my job, but also the whole contemporary landscape. Already practicing computer science at a minimal level, I started a reconversion through the CNED and CNAM in 2017.</p>
<h2 id="how-did-you-experience-your-career-change">How did you experience your career change?</h2>
<p>I am just at the beginning of a career in cybersecurity, as I don&rsquo;t have a job yet. Nevertheless, I am aware of the difficulty of changing my professional field. I am approaching it serenely, because in my current job the ability to adapt is essential! I have developed very useful transversal skills such as project management, personnel management, decision-making on partial perception, &hellip;</p>
<h2 id="what-domains-are-you-particularly-interested-in">What domains are you particularly interested in?</h2>
<p>I am interested in almost every field: I am starting in all of them!</p>
<h1 id="cyber-experience">Cyber Experience</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-a-typical-day-like-a-typical-week-for-you">What is a typical day like? A typical week for you?</h2>
<p>Already working full time in a completely different field, my day starts in the evening, after work. As a father, I divide my time between the screen and my home, and I have to find a balance! I spend about 2 to 3 hours a day in training (Root-Me or CNAM). On weekends, I get up very early to work before going back to work as a father.</p>
<h2 id="what-mistakes-were-you-making-when-you-first-started-in-this-industry">What mistakes were you making when you first started in this industry?</h2>
<p>My main mistake is not to give time to time: I often want to move forward too quickly and sometimes neglect to invest in building a method of action. Developing a cyber survey, acquiring good information gathering practices, is the beginning of a good strategy! Analyze the information, define an area of attack, prepare, execute&hellip;this must speak to some people!</p>
<h2 id="what-were-your-main-challenges-in-learning-this-job">What were your main challenges in learning this job?</h2>
<p>I had a lot of trouble identifying the branches in cyber. &ldquo;Cyber&rdquo; is a &ldquo;suitcase word&rdquo; that encompasses many different things. At the beginning, the people I met in the cyber community made me feel like a novice in the field and didn&rsquo;t give me any information to help me find my way. There are now many more resources, such as the <a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2021/10/anssi-panorama_metiers_cybersecurite-2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">ANSSI Guide Panorama des métiers de la cyber</a> which is quite well done. But that didn&rsquo;t exist when I started.
Another difficulty is that I have to be tenacious, because I work with many very, very good technical profiles. I&rsquo;m more of an organizational person and I have to prove my legitimacy to people who are much more efficient than I am at the technical level.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-you-feel-you-do-better-with-experience">What do you feel you do better with experience?</h2>
<p>The experience allows me to move forward more quickly in the information gathering phase. With the patient repetition of the RM exercises, I have accelerated the process of analysis and construction of an answer. Thanks to certain tools identified in other exercises, I can test hypotheses more easily and manage to &ldquo;open a gap&rdquo; to exploit in the challenge.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-you-see-as-the-most-important-security-challenge-right-now-and-how-do-you-plan-to-contribute-to-it">What do you see as the most important security challenge right now, and how do you plan to contribute to it?</h2>
<p>It is the democratization of computer security for computer professionals but also for the public. In my professional environment, there is a lot of talk about very Hollywood-like attacks by groups of very efficient hackers. But if everyone did the minimum in terms of security, we would already have a more effective protection against many cyber threats.</p>
<h1 id="your-relation-with-root-me">Your relation with Root-Me?</h1>
<h2 id="how-did-root-me-help-you-on-your-career-path">How did Root-Me help you on your career path?</h2>
<p>The beginning of my formation led me towards the computer development (BTS) then towards the analysis of cyber risk, the whole finally rather far from the pure technical field. I quickly perceived that I was taking a path far away from the network and I quickly decided to complete my training via Root-Me in order to cultivate a different approach. My goal was to acquire enough technical skills to have a more informed approach to solving cyber governance problems.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-your-favorite-type-of-challenge-and-why">What is your favorite type of challenge and why??</h2>
<p>I like the challenges that are not &ldquo;real time&rdquo;, like the <a href="https://www.root-me.org/en/Challenges/Forensic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Forensic challenges</a>.
You can spend time &ldquo;cold&rdquo;, analyze and work without necessarily being on the platform, and give an answer in a limited time to be able to do the challenge. I prefer to get files, work on my own and send my solution after.</p>
<h2 id="what-aspects-of-root-me-do-you-appreciate-in-particular">What aspects of Root-Me do you appreciate in particular?</h2>
<p>I have to admit that I took my membership in the association the moment the Discord went public! It was the missing link compared to the previous organization to bring the players closer together and speed up the learning process. I really enjoyed the quizzes as well. 
I haven&rsquo;t tried ctfalltheday yet due to lack of practice. I&rsquo;m catching up on the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/rootme_org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Twitch conferences</a> via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@rootme_org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Youtube replays</a> because I unfortunately don&rsquo;t have the availability to follow them live.</p>
<h2 id="until-today-what-are-your-best-achievements-on-root-me">Until today, what are your best achievements on Root-Me?</h2>
<p>Beyond the fact that I was able to pick up technical bricks through the challenges proposed on Root-Me, the unexpected interest that I found there was the fact that I could network within the cyber community. I came to the platform for educational purposes at first, but I also met people who are well integrated in the community. One of my greatest successes in the end is to have been able to integrate this network.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-the-root-me-community-bring-to-you-that-you-cantdont-think-you-can-find-elsewhere">What does the Root-Me community bring to you that you can&rsquo;t/don&rsquo;t think you can find elsewhere)?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been volunteering for Root-Me for a year. I was initially approached for my development skills and I took charge, with the team, of a part of the Discord bot. Since I started, I&rsquo;ve been working with the Quality Assurance team to keep the bot&rsquo;s code up to date, debug and deploy new tools according to the community&rsquo;s requests. 
As a recent &ldquo;Lead QA&rdquo;, I will be able to train myself to do maintenance on the servers, and later on deploy new challenges myself! 
Although this volunteering has impacted my points curve on RM, I am delighted to be able to participate and benefit from the community to strengthen my skills in this other way.</p>
<h2 id="do-you-have-points-of-improvement-or-wishes-regarding-the-evolution-of-the-platform-that-you-would-like-to-transmit-to-the-root-me-team">Do you have points of improvement or wishes regarding the evolution of the platform that you would like to transmit to the Root-Me team?</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have too much to say to the RM team via this interview! They are accessible enough to have a pleasant and constructive ongoing dialogue.</p>
<h1 id="tips">Tips</h1>
<h2 id="in-your-opinion-what-are-the-main-qualities-needed-to-do-this-job">In your opinion, what are the main qualities needed to do this job?</h2>
<p>Patience, humility, ability to communicate and work as a team.</p>
<h2 id="what-advice-would-you-give-to-someone-considering-a-career-change-in-this-domain">What advice would you give to someone considering a career change in this domain?</h2>
<p>If I had to give advice to ambitious people who want to reconvert, I would say to first approach IT as a whole before starting in cybersecurity. After that, you have to be persistent! The amount of learning in cyber and the fast evolution of the context can sometimes discourage, but we must remember that we are not all asked to become the new Hollywood hackers! A good solution is to identify the field / job that we like the most and to specialize in it.
One last point is to believe in it! I&rsquo;ve met more people who tried to dissuade me from training in cyber than advisors to support me in this process.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-your-ambitions-for-the-future">What are your ambitions for the future?</h2>
<p>I have three levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a Root-Me player I would like to eventually rise to the rank of hacker. This is quite an ambition because I have to score 150 points per week which is a lot of work.</li>
<li>At the level of the Root-Me association I don&rsquo;t intend to stop there, I have just integrated the position of Lead QA and I wish to increase my skills in new missions.</li>
<li>At the professional level I hope to start a job in cyber from next July, and get my engineer title.</li>
