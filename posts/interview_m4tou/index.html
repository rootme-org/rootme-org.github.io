<p><strong>Specialist in maritime navigation, M4tou started a career change in 2017 to work in cybersecurity. During his computer architecture design training, he enthusiastically discovered Root-Me. His previous involvement since 2022 in the non-profit organization Root-Me as a QA team member - team who keeps the platform and challenges under operational control - allowed him to join the QA team as a leader. He is nearing to end his learning within his training and would soon be able to start a new professional journey !</strong></p>
<h1 id="introduction--presentation">Introduction / Presentation</h1>
<h2 id="who-are-you-and-what-are-you-currently-doing-">Who are you and what are you currently doing ?</h2>
<p>I just passed my computer architecture designer diploma and I am getting ready to get my Master Degree as an engineer. In parallel to that I try to get my first job in the field thanks to my diploma, while pursuing my training on Root-Me.</p>
<h2 id="what-got-you-into-cybersecurity-">What got you into cybersecurity ?</h2>
<p>As a specialist in electronic maritime navigation, I realized several years ago that computer threats were going to impact my job, but also the entire contemporary environment. Already practicing computer science at a minimal level, I started a career change through the CNED and CNAM in 2017.</p>
<h2 id="how-did-you-experience-your-career-change-">How did you experience your career change ?</h2>
<p>I just started my cybersecurity career and I don&rsquo;t have a job yet. But I am aware of the hardness of changing my area of practice. I am approaching it serenely, because in my current job the ability to adapt is important and it’s also key in cybersecurity! I also have developed very useful transversal skills such as project management, personnel management, decision-making on partial perception, …</p>
<h2 id="what-domains-are-you-particularly-interested-in-">What domains are you particularly interested in ?</h2>
<p>I am interested in almost every subject: I am starting in all of them!</p>
<h1 id="cyber-experience">Cyber Experience</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-a-typical-day-like-a-typical-week-for-you-">What is a typical day like? A typical week for you ?</h2>
<p>I am already working full time in a completely different activity, my day in cybersecurity starts in the evening, after work. As a father, I split my time between the screen and my home, and I have to find a balance! I spend about 2 to 3 hours per day on training (Root-Me or CNAM). On weekends, I get up very early to work before I become a father again.</p>
<h2 id="what-mistakes-were-you-making-when-you-first-started-in-this-industry-">What mistakes were you making when you first started in this industry ?</h2>
<p>My main mistake is not to give time to time: I often want to move forward too quickly and sometimes neglect to invest in building a method of action. <strong>Tips such as developing a cyber survey, acquiring good information gathering practices, is the beginning of a good strategy !</strong> Analyzing the information, defining an attack area, preparing, executing… that might ring a bell to some people!</p>
<h2 id="what-were-your-main-challenges-in-learning-this-job-">What were your main challenges in learning this job ?</h2>
<p>I had a lot of trouble identifying the branches in cyber. “Cyber” is a “suitcase word” that encompasses many different things. At the beginning, people I met in the cyber community made me feel like a beginner in the field and didn’t give me any information to help me find my way. There are now many more resources, such as the <a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2021/10/anssi-panorama_metiers_cybersecurite-2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">ANSSI Guide Panorama des métiers de la cyber</a>  which is quite well done. But this guide didn’t exist when I started. Another struggle is that I have to be tenacious, because I work with many good technical profiles and I come from an organisational background. I have to prove my legitimacy to people who are much more skilled than I am from a technical point of view.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-you-feel-you-do-better-with-experience-">What do you feel you do better with experience ?</h2>
<p>The experience allows me to move forward more quickly in the information gathering phase. <strong>With the patient repetition of the RM exercises, I have speed up the process of analysing information and building an answer</strong>. Thanks to couple of tools identified in other exercises, I can test hypothesis more easily and manage to “open a gap” to exploit the challenge.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-you-see-as-the-most-important-security-challenge-right-now-and-how-do-you-plan-to-contribute-to-it-">What do you see as the most important security challenge right now, and how do you plan to contribute to it ?</h2>
<p>It is the democratization of computer security for professionals but also for the public. In the environment I work for, there are a lot of talks about Hollywood-like attacks done by different groups of efficient hackers. But if everyone does the minimum in terms of security, we would already have more effective protection against many cyber threats.</p>
<h1 id="your-relation-with-root-me-">Your relation with Root-Me ?</h1>
<h2 id="how-did-root-me-help-you-on-your-career-path-">How did Root-Me help you on your career path ?</h2>
<p>My training started in computer development (BTS) then into cyber risk analysis, which was quite far from the purely technical field. I quickly decided to complete my training via Root-Me in order to nurture a different approach. 
My goal was to acquire enough technical skills be more awarnessly efficient in solving cyber governance issues.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-your-favorite-type-of-challenge-and-why-">What is your favorite type of challenge and why ?</h2>
<p>I like the challenges that are not “real time”, like the <a href="https://www.root-me.org/en/Challenges/Forensic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Forensic challenges</a>. You can spend &lsquo;&lsquo;cold&rsquo;&rsquo; time analyzing, and working without being necessarily on the platform and finally give an answer in a limited time to complete the challenge. I prefer to get files, work on my own and then send my solution.</p>
<h2 id="what-aspects-of-root-me-do-you-appreciate-in-particular-">What aspects of Root-Me do you appreciate in particular ?</h2>
<p>I got my Root-Me membership card the moment the Root-Me Discord went public! It was the missing link compared to the previous organization' model in order to get closer the players together and speed up the learning process. I really enjoyed the quizzes as well. 
I haven’t tried ctfalltheday yet due to lack of practice. I’m catching up on the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/rootme_org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Twitch conferences</a> through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@rootme_org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Youtube replays</a> because I unfortunately don’t have the time to watch them live.</p>
<h2 id="until-today-what-are-your-best-achievements-on-root-me-">Until today, what are your best achievements on Root-Me ?</h2>
<p>Besides acquiring technical skills through the Root-Me challenges, <strong>the unexpected benefit I found was the opportunity to be part of a network within the cyber community</strong>.
At first, I came to the platform for educational purposes, but I met people well integrated within the cyber community. 
At the end, my greatest success, to me, is to be part of to the Root-Me community too.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-the-root-me-community-bring-to-you-that-you-cantdont-think-you-can-find-elsewhere-">What does the Root-Me community bring to you that you can&rsquo;t/don&rsquo;t think you can find elsewhere ?</h2>
<p>I volunteered for Root-Me for a year, approached for my development skills to help develop the Discord bot, as part of the existing team. Since I started, I’ve been working with the Quality Assurance team to keep the bot’s code up to date, debug and deploy new tools according to the community’s requests. 
As a recent &ldquo;Lead QA&rdquo;, I will be able to learn about server maintenance and later create new challenges myself! Although this volunteering time has impacted the evolution of my points on RM, I am delighted to participate and benefit from the community’ advises to strengthen my skills in this other way.</p>
<h2 id="do-you-have-points-of-improvement-or-wishes-regarding-the-evolution-of-the-platform-that-you-would-like-to-transmit-to-the-root-me-team-">Do you have points of improvement or wishes regarding the evolution of the platform that you would like to transmit to the Root-Me team ?</h2>
<p>I don’t have too much to say to the RM team through this interview ! 
They are accessible enough to have a pleasant and constructive ongoing dialogue.</p>
<h1 id="tips">Tips</h1>
<h2 id="in-your-opinion-what-are-the-main-qualities-needed-to-do-this-job-">In your opinion, what are the main qualities needed to do this job ?</h2>
<p>Patience, humility, ability to communicate and team work skilled.</p>
<h2 id="what-advice-would-you-give-to-someone-considering-a-career-change-in-this-domain-">What advice would you give to someone considering a career change in this domain ?</h2>
<p>If I had to give advice to ambitious people who plan to change job, I would advise to approach IT as a whole before starting in cybersecurity. 
A second piece of advice would be to be persistent!
The amount of cyber learning required and the fast evolution of the context can sometimes be discouraging, but you must remember that we are not all asked to become the new Hollywood hackers! 
A good solution is to identify the field / job that you like the most and specialize in it. One last point is to believe in your project! I’ve met more people who tried to discourage me from training in cyber than advisors who supported me in this process.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-your-ambitions-for-the-future-">What are your ambitions for the future ?</h2>
<p>I have ones on three levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a Root-Me player I would like to eventually rise to the rank of hacker. This is quite an ambition because I have to score 150 points per week which is a lot of work.</li>
<li>At the level of the Root-Me non-profit organization I don’t intend to stop there, I have just integrated the position of Lead QA and I wish to increase my skills in new missions.</li>
<li>At the professional level I hope to start a job in cyber from next July, and get my engineer title.</li>
</ul>
